LRU Cache Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. Implement the LRUCache class: LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity. int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1. void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value</description></item><item><title>1694B.

(for example, 𝑇= 010001 contains 4 zeroes and 2 ones, so the score of 𝑇 is $|4−2|=2$). Define the creepiness of some binary string 𝑆 as the maximum score among all of its</description></item><item><title>1693A.

Initially, each element is equal to 0 and there is a pointer located on the first element. We can do the following two kinds of operations any number of times (possibly zero) in any order: If the pointer is not on the last element, increase the element the pointer is currently on by 1. Then move it</description></item><item><title>2306.
